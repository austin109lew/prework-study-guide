## Description

This Project was my Prework Study Guide Website. I built this website to help me better understand all aspects of coding and it definitely helped.I learned how to start a website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While it definitely isnt the best website in the world it definitely did help me understand the world of coding a little bit more.
